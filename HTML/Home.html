    Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of physical fitness related to a specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military applications and some other occupations.</p>

    Specifically designed for educational<br> institutions (research, development and non-commercial institutions that provide initial training) in the fields of automation and drive technology, we offer more than 100 didactically prepared learning and training documents – including projects – for download free of charge. Our learn- & training documents are perfectly matched to curricula and syllabuses and are optimally suited for use with our SCE trainer packages. They also take into account all aspects of a modern industrial solution: installation, configuration, programming, and commissioning. They are based on Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and blended learning concepts for conveying know-how on Industry 4.0. Pedagogics 3.0 concepts and learning as a service contribute to the high quality of our learn-/training documents. All documents can be individually matched to your requirements. Take advantage of our industrial know-how for the practice-oriented, efficient design of your courses.
    Machine learning (ML)-based approaches to<br><br> system development employ a fundamentally different style of programming than historically used in computer science. This approach uses example data to train a model to enable the machine to learn how to perform a task. ML training is highly iterative with each new piece of training data generating trillions of operations. The iterative nature of the training process combined with very large training data sets needed to achieve high accuracy drives a requirement for extremely high-performance floating-point processing. Most new models describe their training requirements in terms of the number of GPU accelerator cards used and the weeks of processing required. Training equipment for typical vision models range in price from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars and will also require power measured in Kilowatts to operate. These are often rack-scale systems. ML training is best implemented as data center infrastructure that can be amortized across many different customers to justify the high capital and operating expense.

Inferencing, on the other hand, is the process of using a trained model to produce a probable match for a new piece of data relative to all the data that the model was trained on. Inferencing, in most applications, looks for quick answers that can be arrived at in milliseconds. Examples of inferencing include speech recognition, real-time language translation, machine vision, and ad insertion optimization decisions. When compared to training, inferencing requires a small fraction of the processing power. However, this is still well beyond the processing provided by traditional CPU-based systems. Thus, even with inferencing, acceleration (either on the SoC as IP or as an in-system accelerator) is required to achieve reasonable execution speeds.
